[{"categories":null,"contents":"To the Slope Community,\nThank you for your support and patience over the course of the last week. We apologize for not being more communicative during these challenging times.\nIt is important to us that we provide you with independently verified facts and a solid plan for the near future, rather than adding to further speculation. Starting from day one, the team has been focused on investigating the root cause of the wallet hack incident and the recovery of assets. We have been working tirelessly over the last week with the auditors OtterSec and SlowMist, and the cybercrime firm TRM. The auditors received full access to all databases, data pipelines, server logs, and application source code. The auditors’ investigations are nearing their conclusion, and we feel it’s now appropriate to provide regular updates.\nBefore we get to that, we want first to say that we sincerely apologize to all those who were affected by the wallet hack last week. We are genuinely sorry for all the losses suffered and are doing everything we can to make it right.\nHere are the most important findings from the independent audits:\nThere was a vulnerability in the Slope on-premise 3rd-party application monitoring service on Slope Wallets on mobile from July 28th to August 3rd that inadvertently logged sensitive data in cases where the apps generated an error event. There is no evidence that all security layers (e.g., transmission and storage) were compromised. All the transmission to the 3rd-party application monitoring server is protected through HTTPS end-to-end encryption, and access to the 3rd-party application monitoring server is controlled through 3-factor authentication. As confirmed in previous interim reports from Ottersec, the investigation team has cross-compared all hacked addresses (9,232 addresses in total) vs. all exposed addresses from the vulnerability in the 3rd-party application monitoring database: -The number of all hacked addresses is larger than the total number of addresses ever exposed from the 3rd-party application monitoring server. -A fraction (1,444 addresses) of the total exposure from the 3rd-party application monitoring server has been confirmed drained in cross-comparison. Although there is no conclusive evidence from the auditors to link the Slope vulnerability to the exploit, its very existence put a lot of assets in danger. This is nowhere near the security standard that Slope set out to establish and maintain, and we are deeply regretful of these occurrences. Security is paramount to us, and our user base is everything. We should never have let this happen.\nWe found no additional vulnerabilities during the investigation and intense scrutiny by multiple parties. Therefore, we believe the latest patched version of Slope Wallet is safe to use. The Slope team will continue to obtain regular audit reports and work with security professionals on a rolling basis.\nWe will work hard to earn your trust back, hunting down the hacker, recovering stolen assets, and making our users whole.\nSo where do we go from here?\nExpect regular updates on the following topics:\nDetailed fact-sheet walk-throughs of the full scope of the vulnerability and everything we’ve learned and improved on going forward. A revamped product roadmap that doubles down on security. Details on the asset recovery measures for compromised wallets. Thank you again for your patience and understanding as we work through this. Please monitor our official Twitter account (@slope_finance) for further updates.\nSincerely, Slope Team\n","date":"August 11, 2022","image":"https://infosec.bankless.community/images/blog/slope-update_huef5343023e4831688698587ebc32b009_66136_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpeg","permalink":"/news/post-2/","title":"Slope Finance Update — 11 August 2022"},{"categories":null,"contents":"InfoSec is back for another seaon at BanklessDAO\nProgram Name: BanklessDAO Information Security Team Program Champion: BogDrakonov#1337 Start Date: August 8th, 2022 End Date: October 30th, 2022 Meeting Discussions: InfoSec Meetings are held Wednesdays at 7pm EST\nProgram Justification BanklessDAO members and crypto users as a whole have suffered many personal security breaches of their wallets, accounts, and other resources. After a serious round of Discord Nitro phishing campaigns 1 and a constant raid of spam bots, and scammers in Season 3, and random continued attacks throughout Season 4, the DAO’s need for an InfoSec team remains high in Season 5. We’ve seen a few long standing members also get hit with sophisticated phishing attacks targeting BANK holders.\nInfoSec continues to manage GitHub, Google Workspace, and AWS as we continue to leverage some of these Web2 vendors for the benefit of the DAO.\nWe plan on continuing to fine tune our anti-spam/scam measures as well as improve our educational materials in Season 5. In Season 5 we plan to host live training and workshops to teach everything from Crypto Wallet Security 101 to advanced personal OpSec to avoid falling for scams.\nThe success of the InfoSec team will be measurable by a few key points:\n BanklessDAO members, contributors, and guests gain an overall better understanding of how to stay safe online, and how to remain safe when transacting on EVM-based networks. BanklessDAO remains secure against data breaches, attacks, vandalism, and theft/fraud. Educational programs and content around information security, resulting in peer to peer education amongst Discord members, and the wider Bankless community Timely support and operations of Web2 vendors under the InfoSec Team’s purview.  Program Terms The BanklessDAO InfoSec team is cross-functional in nature, as information security is everyone’s responsibility. In order to remain transparent, the InfoSec team acts as an independent “project” and is not tied to any guild. We will collaborate heavily with every guild and project to provide security advice and operations wherever they may be needed. Some core cross-collab operations include:\n Gatekeeping access and evaluating Principle of Least Privilege across the DAO. Monitoring and alerting on critical systems where an intrusion would publicly harm the DAO (ie: defaced websites, DEGEN infrastructure takeover, email spam from @bankless.community addresses, etc…) Securing the bankless.community DNS service with logged and gated access via Route53 Help with improvements to onboarding new DAO members, and the DAO-curious to proper personal operational security (OpSec) around protecting your accounts and assets. (ie: First quest security tasks, easy to follow guides and educational material, newsletter and Medium content) Collaborate with various projects during their design to help keep a “Security First” mindset without getting in the way of work Collaborate with the Writers Guild and EPA to develop and publish content both in bDAO’s Weekly Rollup and on its Medium page. At least initially, there would be a regular - InfoSec or OpSec column to provide a forum to educate DAO members on best practices in the Weekly rollup.
