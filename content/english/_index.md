- title: "BanklessDAO InfoSec Season 5"
  date: 2022-07-19T10:07:21-05:00
  source: "InfoSec Team"
  content: "BanklessDAO members and crypto users as a whole have suffered many personal security breaches of their wallets, accounts, and other resources. After a serious round of Discord Nitro phishing campaigns 1 and a constant raid of spam bots, and scammers in Season 3, and random continued attacks throughout Season 4, the DAO’s need for an InfoSec team remains high in Season 5. We’ve seen a few long standing members also get hit with sophisticated phishing attacks targeting BANK holders.

InfoSec continues to manage GitHub, Google Workspace, and AWS as we continue to leverage some of these Web2 vendors for the benefit of the DAO."
